In this paper, we analyze the deoptimization behavior of the Graal compiler integrated in HotSpot VM. In particular, we discuss two buggy cases regarding repeated deoptimization/recompilation. We also implement two additional deoptimization strategies to study the effect of tolerating deoptimizations w.r.t. the startup performance.
